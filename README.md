## Overview

<i>Astro-Fit of the Day</i>  is an application using NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day API](https://api.nasa.gov/) to render cards created from the data in the API. There is a home page to view all of the cards pulled from the API, with the option to like and unlike a card. Users can also view more information about the page after clicking on a card, which leads them to further information pulled from the API.  The application was built using React.
